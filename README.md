## Interface

The interface is [defined here.](https://github.com/xchainjs/xchainjs-lib/blob/master/packages/xchain-client/README.md)

### Common Interface

A single common interface:

1. Initialise with a valid BIP39 phrase and specified network (testnet/mainnet)
2. Get the address, with support for BIP44 path derivations (default is Index 0)
3. Get the balance (UTXO or account-based)
4. Get transaction history for that address
5. Make a simple transfer
6. Get blockchain fee information (standard, fast, fastest)

## Advanced Features

For wallets that need even more flexibility (smart contract blockchains) the client can be retrieved and the wallet is then free to handle directly.

## XChainJS uses following libraries, frameworks and more:

- [BitcoinJS](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib)
- [@binance-chain/javascript-sdk](https://github.com/binance-chain/javascript-sdk)
- [@ethersproject](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js)
- [cosmos-client](https://github.com/cosmos-client/cosmos-client-ts)
- [PolkadotJS](https://github.com/polkadot-js)

![Test](https://github.com/thorchain/asgardex-electron/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

## Tests

Make sure Jest and Lerna is installed
```
yarn add --dev jest lerna
```

Start with
```
yarn
yarn build
```

### `unit`

```bash
yarn test
```

## Integration Tests

There are a suite of integration test which work against testnet. You will need to specify a phrase which controls testnet coins

```bash
export PHRASE="secret phrase here"
yarn e2e
```

## Development

`lerna bootstrap`

## Releasing

To test the publish via a dryrun:

```
NPM_USERNAME="test123" NPM_PASSWORD="test123" NPM_EMAIL="test123@test123.com" ./dryrun_publish.sh

```

To publish:

```
NPM_USERNAME="TODO Use real npm username" NPM_PASSWORD="TODO Use real npm password" NPM_EMAIL="TODO Use real npm email" ./publish.sh

```
